# DATOneArchiver

For as long as the [TT Games Modding Community](https://discord.gg/ttlegomods) has existed, so has a **big** problem.  The majority of the games require their data to be bundled inside of **opaque**, **proprietary**, and **ugly** archive files known none-other as **DAT files** (.dat is the extension, short for "data" of course.  Very creative TT devs... ðŸ™„).  

Thankfully, a long time ago on a computer no more than half the circumference of Earth away, a clever programmer known as **Luigi "Aluigi" Auriemma** took the time and energy to reverse engineer the **many variations** *(more info on that later)* of the DAT file format to the point that their data can be extracted, decompressed, and, under some circumstances, modified on a per file basis using a tool of his own design named **[QuickBMS](http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm)**.  

However, that last part has severe limitations.  To modify a file within a DAT archive using **QuickBMS**:

1. The file must already exist within the DAT archive.  In other words, if `fart.txt` does not already exist in `POTTY_HUMOR.DAT`, you're out of luck; It cannot be added.  
2. The new version must be either smaller than or the same size as the current in-archive data
3. You must be lucky (somewhat). **QuickBMS**, like all other software, isn't perfect.  Bugs exist that can and will screw stuff up.  

**Enter DATOneArchiver**. Though it is not a be-all, end-all solution, it has the potential to become just that.  

## What it do?

**DATOneArchiver** in it's current state (v1.0) is a complete toolset for extracting, modifying, and creating TT Games DAT archive files for these games:

* Lego Star Wars: The Video Game (**PC**, Mac, **PS2**, Xbox, GameCube)
* Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy (PC, Mac, **PS2**, Xbox, GameCube)

Platforms that have been tested and confirmed working are **bolded** above.  However, theoretically all of those listed should work.  See **Help Wanted** for info on how you can help fill in the blanks.  

## How get?

**DATOneArchiver** is a command-line based tool written in .NET (currently targets 5.x).  To use the tool, it can either be compiled or downloaded pre-built (recommended).

### To Compile

1. Download and install
   1. [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
   2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
2. Open up a terminal and enter
   1. `git clone https://www.github.com/yodadude2003/DATOneArchiver.git`
   2. `cd DATOneArchiver`
   3. `git submodule update --init --recursive`
   4. `cd DATOneArchiver` (yes, again)
   5. `dotnet build -c Release`
3. Find your binaries. Should be in `bin/Release/net5.0`. 
4. Copy the `propack_bin` folder to this location and rename it to `propack` (or compile the code found in `rnc_propack` and relocate it in a similar fashion)
5. Proceed with **How Use?** instructions

### To Download

1. Download and install the [.NET 5 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
2. Download the **latest release** here on GitHub or on the [Chosen Few Software website](https://www.chosenfewsoftware.com/)
3. Extract the zip archive wherever you please
4. Proceed with **How Use?** instructions

## How Use?

Well, depends on exactly *what* you want to do with it!  First of all, nab a DAT file from your nearest copy of LSW1 or LSW2 and place it in a given directory.  From now on we will refer to the full path of this file as `<archive-path>`.  

Please note the following: 

* You may want to add the **DATOneArchiver** binaries directory to your `PATH` for convenience.  
* All further instructions require the use of a command-line shell.  `cmd` is best on Windows systems.  If you don't know how to access/use it, use Google or your favorite alternative search engine.

Launch a command-line shell instance in the **DATOneArchiver** binaries directory (or if you added it to `PATH`, wherever else is most convenient).  Next find your preferred action below.

### To List Contents

`datonearchiver list -f <archive-path> [-e little|big] [-d <list-dir>]`

Verb: `list`

Parameters:

* `-f` (required): Path to an archive file the user desires to list the contents of.

* `-e` (optional): Endianness of the archive file.  Value must be either `little` or `big`.  Defaults to `little` if left unspecified.

* `-d` (optional): Path of directory/subdirectory within the archive file to list the contents of.  Useful for making output less verbose in cases where the user is only interested in listing a portion of the contents.  Entire archive tree is printed if left unspecified.  

Expected behavior: 

Outputs "ASCII art" file tree of DAT archive contents; similar to the `tree` command from Windows/MS-DOS.  

### To Extract Contents

`datonearchiver extract -f <archive-path> -o <output-dir> [-c] [-e little|big]`

Verb: `extract`

Parameters:

* `-f` (required): Path to an archive file the user desires to extract the contents of.  Wildcards are allowed.

* `-o` (required): Path of a directory to create and extract the archive data to.  
* `-c` (optional): If specified, signals **DATOneArchiver** to decompress any compressed files it finds during extraction (if the compression scheme is supported.  See **Help Wanted**).  Otherwise, all files will be extracted in their raw, compressed form.  
* `-e` (optional): Endianness of the archive file.  Value must be either `little` or `big`.  Defaults to `little` if left unspecified.

### To Modify/Add to Contents

`datonearchiver modify -f <archive-path> -g lsw1|lsw2 -p <patch-dir> [-o <output-file>] [-e little|big]`

Verb: `modify`

Parameters:

* `-f` (required): Path to an archive file the user desires to modify the contents of.
* `-g` (required): The game that the output archive is going to be used with.  Value must be either `lsw1` or `lsw2`.
* `-p` (required): Path to a directory in which the files the user desires to inject reside, structured similarly to the contents of the target archive.

* `-o` (optional): If unspecified, **DATOneArchiver** will overwrite the input archive with the desired modifications.  To prevent data loss, the user may specify a path to a new file in which the modified output is placed.
* `-e` (optional): Endianness of the archive file.  Value must be either `little` or `big`.  Defaults to `little` if left unspecified.

### To Create an Archive from Scratch

`datonearchiver build -f <archive-path> -g lsw1|lsw2 -d <data-dir> [-a <alignment-size>] [-e little|big]`

Verb: `build`

Parameters:

* `-f` (required): Path of the new archive file that is to be created.
* `-g` (required): The game that the output archive is going to be used with.  Value must be either `lsw1` or `lsw2`.

* `-d` (required): Path to the directory that should be made into an archive.
* `-a` (optional): A decimal integer number representing a size in bytes.  If specified, archive contents will be padded so that the beginning of every file is aligned to the specified boundary.  Otherwise, no padding is added.  Use `-a 2048` when making archive files for the PS2 games.  
* `-e` (optional): Endianness of the archive file.  Value must be either `little` or `big`.  Defaults to `little` if left unspecified.
